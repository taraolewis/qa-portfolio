<h2>About Me</h2>

<div class="content-section">
  <p>
    Hi, I’m Tara Lewis, based in London, and I recently completed a software
    development coding bootcamp, which built on my passion for creating digital
    experiences—a passion that began during my Fine Art degree and continued
    through my Creative Computing Diploma.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would describe myself as a responsible and reliable professional with a
    proactive and ambitious approach. I’m a good listener and thrive in
    collaborative environments, valuing clear communication and teamwork. My
    background in the arts has made me highly creative, giving me a unique
    perspective that I bring to all areas of my work.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy turning ideas into engaging, accessible, and functional digital
    experiences. I’m particularly passionate about front-end development,
    designing interfaces that are both visually appealing and user-friendly.
  </p>
