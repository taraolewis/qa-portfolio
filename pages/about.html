<h2>About Me</h2>

<div class="content-section">
  <p>
    Hi, I am Tara Lewis, a London based Junior Software Tester with a background
    in full-stack development. I recently completed the Northcoders Software
    Development Bootcamp, where I built and tested applications using
    JavaScript, React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL while working in Agile teams and
    applying test-driven development practices.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have a strong interest in software quality, reliability, and user
    experience. Through practical project work, I gained experience writing unit
    and integration tests using Jest and Supertest, identifying defects, and
    ensuring applications behave consistently and predictably. My development
    background enables me to understand how features are implemented, which
    helps me identify edge cases and potential points of failure.
  </p>

  <p>
    My Fine Art background has strengthened my attention to detail, structured
    problem solving, and independent project management. I approach testing with
    a methodical mindset, clear documentation, and a focus on delivering stable
    and maintainable software.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am motivated by continuous learning, iterative improvement, and
    contributing to collaborative teams where quality and communication are
    prioritised.
  </p>
