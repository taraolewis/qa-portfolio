<h2>About Me</h2>

<div class="content-section">
  <p>
    Hi, I’m Tara Lewis, based in London, and I recently completed a software
    development coding bootcamp, which built on my passion for creating digital
    experiences. A passion that began during my Fine Art degree and continued
    through my Creative Computing Diploma.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would describe myself as a responsible and reliable professional with a
    proactive and ambitious approach. I thrive in collaborative environments,
    value clear communication, and enjoy working closely with others to solve
    problems. My background in the arts has shaped how I approach design,
    combining creativity with structure and attention to detail.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy turning ideas into clear, accessible, and user centred digital
    solutions, with a particular interest in interaction design and consistency
    across interfaces. My technical foundation helps me think practically about
    how designs are built, enabling effective collaboration with developers and
    thoughtful design decisions that scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m motivated by learning, iteration, and improving digital experiences
    through thoughtful design.
  </p>
