<h2>NC News API Back-end</h2>

    <p>
      This project is the backend API for the NC News application, built as part
      of my Northcoders coding bootcamp. The API powers a news application,
      allowing users to fetch and interact with articles, topics, comments, and
      users. Users can read, post, update, and delete comments, as well as
      filter articles by topic, author, or date. The project follows a
      test-driven development approach using Jest and includes robust error
      handling with clear messages for invalid requests. Building the API helped
      me understand how user actions map to system behaviour, and how clear data
      structures and error handling support reliable and predictable user
      experiences.

    <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem">Challenges & Learnings</h3>
    <p>
      Building the API taught me how to structure endpoints and handle database
      relationships efficiently. Writing tests with Jest improved my confidence
      in delivering bug-free, maintainable code.
