    <p>
      This project is the RESTful API for the NC News application, built during
      my Northcoders bootcamp. I created endpoints to manage articles, topics,
      comments, and users, using PostgreSQL to store and retrieve data. The API
      supports filtering and sorting articles, adding and deleting comments, and
      returning structured responses with clear error handling. I used a
      test-driven approach with Jest and Supertest to make sure each endpoint
      behaved as expected and handled invalid requests properly.

    <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem">What I Learned</h3>
    <p>
      This project helped me understand how backend systems are structured and
      how APIs connect to a frontend application. It strengthened my confidence
      working with databases, handling errors, and building reliable endpoints.
