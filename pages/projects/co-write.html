<h2>Co-Write: Collaborative Story Writing App</h2>

<div class="projects-grid">
  <div class="project-card">
    <p>
      Co-Write is a mobile application developed as a group project during
      Northcoders Bootcamp. The application allows users to create and
      contribute to shared stories in real time, with authentication, data
      persistence, and external API integration. A key focus was ensuring
      reliable collaborative behaviour and consistent state management across
      multiple users.
    </p>

    <p>
      Built over three weeks in an Agile team, the project required careful
      handling of user authentication, asynchronous updates, and API responses.
      I contributed to validating feature behaviour, testing edge cases, and
      debugging issues to maintain stable functionality across the application.
    </p>

    <h3>Testing and Behaviour Focus</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Validated authentication flow using Firebase</li>
      <li>Tested real time updates to ensure consistent shared state</li>
      <li>Verified word limit enforcement and voting logic</li>
      <li>Handled API delays and failure responses gracefully</li>
      <li>Tested navigation flows across multiple mobile screens</li>
      <li>Manually tested on different device sizes for layout stability</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>User authentication with Firebase</li>
      <li>Create and contribute to collaborative story threads</li>
      <li>AI generated story continuation using external APIs</li>
      <li>View completed stories with generated images</li>
      <li>Real time updates to support collaborative editing</li>
      <li>Word limit enforcement and voting system</li>
      <li>Mobile first design built with React Native</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem">Challenges and Learnings</h3>
    <p>
      This project strengthened my understanding of how collaborative systems
      must manage shared state and asynchronous behaviour. I learned to
      anticipate race conditions, inconsistent updates, and API failures, and to
      design defensive logic that protects the user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working in a team also reinforced the importance of clear communication,
      documenting issues, and testing new features carefully before merging
      changes.

      <h3>Planning and Layout</h3>
      <p>
        Flow diagrams and wireframes were used to define user journeys and
        feature behaviour before implementation. This planning supported clearer
        identification of edge cases and improved validation of user flows
        during development.
