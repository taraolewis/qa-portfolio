    <p>
      Co-Write is a mobile application developed as a group project during my
      Northcoders bootcamp. The app allows users to create and contribute to
      shared stories, with user authentication and persistent data storage
      through Firebase.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working in an Agile team over three weeks, I contributed by building
      several screens and UI components, including buttons and interactive
      elements, and helping shape the overall interface design. I also worked on
      managing application state and handling asynchronous updates to ensure
      changes were reflected consistently across users.

    <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem">What I Learned</h3>
    <p>
      This project helped me better understand how collaborative applications
      manage shared data and state changes. I gained experience working with
      TypeScript in a team project, building structured components, and
      connecting frontend features to backend services. It also strengthened my
      collaboration skills, version control practices, and confidence
      contributing to a larger codebase.
