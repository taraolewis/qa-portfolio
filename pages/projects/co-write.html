    <p>
      Co-Write is a mobile application developed as a group project at
      Northcoders Bootcamp. The goal was to design an intuitive experience that
      enables users to co-create narratives in real time, contribute
      meaningfully to shared stories, and explore completed work in an engaging,
      accessible format.
    </p>

    <p>
      This MVP was designed and built over three weeks, with a focus on clear
      user flows, interaction feedback, and collaborative behaviour within a
      constrained mobile interface.

    <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem">Challenges & Learnings</h3>
    <p>
      Designing Co-Write helped me develop a stronger understanding of
      collaborative UX patterns, including how users discover, join, and
      contribute to shared content. Working in a team required aligning on
      interaction decisions, handling feedback, and iterating on flows based on
      usability and clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Building for mobile also strengthened my approach to information
      hierarchy, affordances, and accessibility, while balancing technical
      constraints with user needs.
