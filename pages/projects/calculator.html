    <p>
      A mobile calculator built with React Native and Expo. This project focuses
      on logical accuracy, input handling, and predictable behaviour across a
      range of user interactions. It was a useful space to practice validating
      requirements, checking edge cases, and ensuring consistent results.
    </p>

    <h3>Testing and Behaviour Focus</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Validated calculation logic for common and edge case inputs</li>
      <li>
        Handled repeated taps, rapid input changes, and unexpected sequences
      </li>
      <li>Ensured clear and undo actions reset state consistently</li>
      <li>Verified behaviour for divide by zero and invalid operations</li>
      <li>Checked display formatting for long numbers and decimal input</li>
      <li>Manually tested across device sizes to confirm layout stability</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Basic arithmetic operations including add, subtract, multiply, and
        divide
      </li>
      <li>Clear layout with readable hierarchy</li>
      <li>Responsive layout across devices</li>
      <li>Touchable buttons designed for mobile use</li>
      <li>Immediate feedback during input and actions</li>
      <li>Clear and undo actions to reduce mistakes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This project reinforced the importance of testing logic with a wide range
      of inputs and interaction sequences, not only expected usage. It improved
      my ability to think in terms of boundary cases, state management, and
      predictable outcomes, which are central to delivering reliable software.
