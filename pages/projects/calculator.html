    <p>
      A mobile calculator built with React Native and Expo. This project focused
      on building the core calculation logic and managing state so results
      update correctly as users interact with the app. The goal was to ensure
      the app behaved consistently and predictably.

    <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem">What I Learned</h3>
    <p>
      This project improved my understanding of state management and logical
      flow in a React Native application. It helped me think more carefully
      about how user input affects application behaviour.
