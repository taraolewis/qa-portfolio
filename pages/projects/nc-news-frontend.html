    <p>
      This project is the front-end of the NC News application, built as part of
      my Northcoders coding bootcamp. The app is a responsive news web
      application that allows users to browse, read, and interact with articles
      on a variety of topics. It connects to the NC News API to provide dynamic
      content and real time user interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The focus of the project was creating a clear and intuitive interface for
      content heavy information, ensuring users can easily filter articles, read
      comments, and interact through voting and discussion.

    <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem">Challenges & Learnings</h3>
    <p>
      Building the front-end helped me understand how interface decisions affect
      usability, particularly when working with dynamic data. I focused on
      handling loading, error, and empty states clearly so users always
      understood what was happening. Designing the layout for different screen
      sizes reinforced the importance of hierarchy, spacing, and readability in
      content heavy interfaces. Integrating user interactions such as voting and
      commenting highlighted the value of immediate feedback in creating a
      responsive and engaging user experience.

          <h3>Planning & Layout</h3>
          <p>
            Early wireframes were used to plan layout, content hierarchy, and
            interaction flow before implementation, helping to keep the
            interface clear and consistent as features were added.
