<h2>Portfolio Website</h2>

<div class="projects-grid">
  <div class="project-card">
    <p>
      A responsive multi page portfolio built to present my projects and skills
      clearly and reliably. The site was planned using Figma wireframes, then
      developed with a focus on accessibility, consistent behaviour, and cross
      device testing to ensure the content renders correctly and remains easy to
      navigate.
    </p>

    <h3>Testing and Behaviour Focus</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Validated navigation and page routing to prevent broken paths</li>
      <li>Checked layout stability across screen sizes and devices</li>
      <li>Tested keyboard navigation and semantic HTML structure</li>
      <li>
        Reviewed colour contrast, headings, and link clarity for accessibility
      </li>
      <li>Verified responsive images, spacing, and typography consistency</li>
      <li>Deployed and iterated based on issues found during real use</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Clear content structure to help users understand my work and skills
        quickly
      </li>
      <li>Responsive layout for desktop and mobile</li>
      <li>Consistent spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy</li>
      <li>Accessible front end practices using semantic HTML</li>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem">Challenges and Learnings</h3>
    <p>
      Building and deploying this site strengthened my ability to validate
      front-end behaviour in real conditions. It improved my approach to
      checking accessibility, identifying layout edge cases, and ensuring
      consistent presentation across different browsers and screen sizes.

    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p>
      Early planning focused on defining key content sections and layout
      structure before development. This supported clearer navigation, improved
      consistency across pages, and made it easier to validate user journeys
      during implementation and testing.
