        This 7 minute video explores the blur between the real and the virtual
        worlds, using 3D models of people I know combined with a 360 degree
        environment. Accompanied by ambient music made on Logic Pro, it reflects
        on human identity, technological advancement, and the uncertainty of the
        future, highlighting the uncanny and the unknown in a digital context.

        This video explores the blur between the real and the virtual by
        combining The Sims visuals with a custom soundtrack created in Logic
        Pro. The triptych format and layered music create an immersive, slightly
        distorted atmosphere, highlighting the interplay between digital
        environments and narrative experience while reflecting on how virtual
        worlds can reshape perception and storytelling.

        This video explores the impact of rising sea levels on London, focusing
        on Sheerness as a key indicator of climate change and the Thames Barrier
        closures. Using generative visuals and custom coded sounds created in
        Pure Data, I layered data driven audio with underwater inspired effects
        to highlight the increasing risk and urgency of climate change. The
        video gradually evolves in tone and saturation, reflecting the growing
        danger and encouraging awareness of our planet’s fragile future.

        This video demonstrates an interactive artwork I created using P5.js,
        Arduino, and a distance sensor. The projection of colored rectangles
        responds to a viewer’s proximity, exploring the relationship between our
        physical presence and our digital self. While this video shows the
        project on a laptop, the final installation is designed for a gallery
        setting, where the sensor subtly alters the projected image, creating a
        playful and engaging interaction.
